            <p>
                The charming effect of the water coming down the steps is to be seen to be believed. These days,
                visitors from neighbouring Balasore,Bhadrak,Keonjhor districts and from places including West-bengal and
                Jharkhand sates are flock to the spot and capture the moments in photographs.
                Since the flow of water is slow, starting from children to elders,everyone can enjoy here.Similipal
                green forest with the blue sky streching over like a canopy and below the reservoir give the visitors an
                experience of a lifetiime.
                Describing their exhilarating, a visitor Debidarshani behera said,"I feel lucky because during our stay
                there were cotton candy clouds floting in the sky and at the same time ,the sun was setting down the
                horizon, scattering its bright golden rays on the water of the reservoir. i can never forget the moments
                we spent here".
                Similarly the local people urged the administration to resurrect the dam and develop the place as a
                tourist spot by setting up a park so that tourists, instead of coming only during the rainy season, can
                visit the spot all through the year.
